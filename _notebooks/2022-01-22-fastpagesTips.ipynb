    "The fastpages platform is an excellent option for creating your own blog, hosted free on Github. The platform supports Jupyter notebooks, Word documents and Markdown, which is right in the wheelhouse for many analysts, data scientists and programmers. My knowledge of HTML and website development is limited and I've just recently created my first blog on the fastpages platform. I discovered the learning curve to customize the platform can be steep, but I enjoy digging into new technology. I thought it would be beneficial to assemble a post to help others in their journey.\n",

In this post, I will review some simple code that you can implement.\n",
