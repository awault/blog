    "The fastpages platform is an excellent tool for creating your own blog, hosted free on Github. The platform supports Jupyter notebooks, Word documents and Markdown, which is right in the wheelhouse for many analysts, data scientists and programmers or those with aspirations to work in these fields. Personally, I fit more in the analyst and aspiring programmer bucket. My knowledge of HTML is limited and I've just recently created my first blog on the fastpages platform. I discovered the learning curve to customize the platform can be steep, but I enjoy learning and digging into new technology. \n",

In this post, we will review some simple techniques that you can implement to personalize your website. \n",
